                        <h4>The Bretton Woods system</h4>
                        <h5>The Bretton Woods currency system was a currency regulation, the rules of which were reflected in an agreement signed by representatives of more than 40 countries during the UN special conference. The currency system received its name at the venue of the UN special conference - the resort of Bretton Woods in the United States. It was in 1944 that a decision was made to create the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which formed the basis of a new currency system.</h5>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-12">
                        <p>The main goal of the Bretton Woods currency system was to provide certain freedoms in global trade and stabilize exchange rates by connecting them to the US dollar and gold. In fact, the dollar has become a global currency.</p>
                        <p>The crisis of the Bretton Woods system was caused by a change in the correlation of the main forces of the global economy and weakening US dollar. Since the US currency was the main currency of the system, its fall led to the destruction of fixed rates and, as a result, collapse of the entire currency system.</p>
                        <p>The Bretton Woods system was able to manage only part of the tasks it was created for. However, after the system collapsed, a new practice came into place - currency trading.</p>
                        <p>Such a system could work seamlessly while the US gold reserves allowed free conversion of the greenback. In practice, this situation did not last long.</p>

                        <h5>Forex is an abbreviation for FOReign EXchange.
                            In 1971, Richard Nixon, the 37th US President, decided to abandon the gold standard. This measure led to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the creation of a new system with  floating foreign exchange rates. As a result, these changes served as a starting point of currency trading that took place in the international currency market.</h5>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-12">
                        <p>However, the market that we are dealing with today appeared five years later, in 1976, when a decision on the international monetary system was made at a meeting of 20 IMF ministers in Kingston. From that moment on, the only way to exchange currencies was to become free floating rates. Countries that have adopted a system of floating exchange rates have ceased to have money backed by gold. Since that moment, the currency has become freely convertible.</p>
                        <p>In 1979, members of the European Community, pursuing integration goals in the economic space, introduced measures to promote the stability of the national currency, as well as to guard against the massive penetration of the US dollar into the European market, which resulted in the creation of a unified European monetary system. The European monetary system was based on the European Currency Unit (ECU). Over time, the European Currency Unit (ECU) began to be used not only in interstate, but also in private calculations.</p>
                        <p>In 1990, the United Kingdom joined the system of exchange rates. Two years after the fall of the pound sterling, the British authorities decided to withdraw from the European Monetary System.</p>
                        <p>In 1999, the ECU gave way to the Euro, and already in 2002 the Euro was put into circulation. 12 countries participated in this agreement.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to the development of information technology and constant fluctuations in exchange rates, there is an opportunity to derive profits from currency differences. The advent of the worldwide Internet enabled the Forex market to operate 24 hours five days a week, opening access to private speculators.</p>
                        <p>To date, the international currency market is the largest market in the world. The daily turnover of trading on it is from 2 to 4 trillion dollars.</p>
